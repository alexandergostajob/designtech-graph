View the application at: https://alexandergostajob.github.io/designtech-graph/

## Overview
This application is an interactive visualization tool built to explore and analyze the usage and interoperability of design technology tools across different companies. It provides a dynamic graph-based interface where users can explore relationships between various design tools, their users, and how they interact within the industry.

## Purpose
The application was created to:
- Visualize the interconnections between different design technology tools
- Map out which companies use specific design tools
- Identify interoperability between different tools
- Provide insights into the design technology ecosystem

## Features
- Interactive graph visualization using ReactFlow
- Force-directed layout powered by D3-force
- Floating edges and custom node designs
- Type filtering panel for different node categories
- Vertical and horizontal arrangement options
- Mini-map for easy navigation
- Controls for zooming and panning
- Node collision detection
- Dynamic edge connections
